		     <h2>Architecure 🏛</h2> 
		     <p>I am an architecture enthusiast. Living in Paris since I was born, I have developed a taste for observing the architecture of this beautiful French capital with its Haussmannian buildings.</p>

		     <h2>Art 👩‍🎨</h2>   
		     <p>I really like art in all its forms. I love going to see exhibitions. I am inspired by contemporary art artists like Basquiat, Warhol and Magritte with surrealism.Photographers have made an impression on me like Irving Penn, a fashion photographer who worked for Vogue and made advertisements for Loreal and other famous prints.

		     <h2>Mode🧵</h2>   
		     <p>I love the lively fashion in Paris, the centre of fashion, and I was able to observe the Parisian style in the streets. I also appreciate the work of designers such as Isabel Marant and Jacquemus, who highlight the Provençal woman, breaking away from the historical model of the Parisian woman, and I also like haute couture houses such as Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent.</p>
